# Shooting Game
A basic game built using Python's pygame library. 

## Steps to run the application:

- You should first fork the repository or clone it directly from here with the following command:
`git clone <repository_url>`

- `cd` into the directory where the game has been cloned and install the `pygame` library with `pip`. If you don't have pip, install `pip` first. The command is as follows:
`pip install pygame`

- Run the game with `python Shootinggame.py` on Windows or `py Shootinggame.py` on Linux.

- A customized pygame window will pop up and you can play the game now. Yay!
